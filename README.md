## What is this Project all about?
In this project, I have tried to build a Movie Recommender System using two-stage (or) bi-layered classification system. So to say, 
a Dataset (Memory) and Classification (Model) based System. In other words, a simple implementation of Collaborative Filtering.

I collaborated with [Pragyaditya Das](https://github.com/Jeet1994) for this project.

##What have I used?
I have used *Python* for the coding, scrapping and system design. 
In addition to that, I have used,
* Numpy
* Pandas
*Matplotlib.


## Motivation 
* A want to learn Data Science.
* Interest and Passion towards the field.
